# Rainbow

This is Rainbow :rainbow:, an implementation of some AWS services for local development.

## Questions

* Why not LocalStack?

LocalStack is great for some use cases, but I wanted something that was better for a long-lived local implementation of
AWS services. Specifically, [better S3 storage](https://github.com/ATenderholt/rainbow-storage) and more
[seamless Lambda development](https://github.com/ATenderholt/rainbow-functions), along with not pegging CPU
when constantly consuming from queues.

Plus, I wanted to learn Go.

* Where did the name Rainbow come from?

I was thinking about various project names over the course of several days. Nothing seemed quite right until I was 
hanging out in my daughter's room, and I realized the name of this project was all around me.
